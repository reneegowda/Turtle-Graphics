# Turtle-Graphics
This Python module is designed to explore and implement a variety of geometric shapes and graphics using the introcs Turtle library. It covers both basic and advanced techniques in Turtle graphics, as well as concepts like recursion and precondition enforcement. The project includes a set of tasks, each focused on a different aspect of Turtle graphics, and showcases essential Python skills such as function definitions, conditional logic, and parameter validation.

Skills Covered:
Introduction to Turtle Graphics: An introduction to the Python turtle module, enabling users to create graphics by controlling a turtle on the screen.
Using a Window: Setting up and managing the Turtle graphics window to display shapes and manage the drawing environment.
Using a Turtle: Creating and controlling the movement of a turtle, including changing direction, speed, and drawing shapes.
Using a Pen: Applying pen functionality to draw shapes, including controlling line thickness and color.
Assignment Source Code: The code demonstrates the application of fundamental programming techniques like function calls, loops, and conditionals.
Precondition Enforcement: Functions that include checks to ensure input values are valid (e.g., ensuring a positive size for shapes).

Tasks:
Task 1: Triangles
Draw various types of triangles using loops and conditional logic, demonstrating the basic use of Turtle graphics.

Task 2: Hexagons
Explore geometric symmetry by creating hexagons with customizable side lengths.

Task 3: Radial Shapes
Create radial patterns by drawing multiple copies of shapes like squares or triangles in a circular arrangement, emphasizing Turtle movement in angles.

Task 4: Recursive Fractals
Implement recursive functions to generate fractal shapes such as the Sierpinski Triangle, showcasing the power of recursion in Turtle graphics.

Task 5: Minkowski Island
Draw a fractal known as the Minkowski Island, which demonstrates more advanced recursion and fractal geometry.
